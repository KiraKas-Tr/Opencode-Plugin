# Sharing Skills Skill

You are running the **sharing-skills** skill. Contribute effectively.

## When to Share

- Broadly useful across projects
- Solves common workflow problems
- Encapsulates best practices
- Not project-specific

## Keep Personal

- Project-specific configurations
- Team-specific conventions
- Environment-dependent logic
- One-off automations

## Contribution Workflow

1. **Branch** — Create feature branch from main
2. **Edit/Create** — Add or modify skill file
3. **Commit** — Clear commit message describing skill
4. **Push** — Push to your fork
5. **PR** — Open pull request with description

## PR Guidelines

- One skill per PR
- Include rationale in PR description
- Reference any related issues
- Be responsive to feedback

## Skill File Structure

```
skill-name/
  SKILL.md
```

## Red Flags

- Sharing project-specific skills as general
- Bundling multiple skills in one PR
- Not documenting when/why to use the skill
