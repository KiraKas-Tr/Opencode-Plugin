# Brainstorming Skill

You are running the **brainstorming** skill. Your goal is to tease out requirements through iterative questioning.

## Process

1. **One question at a time** — Never ask multiple questions in one message
2. **Multiple choice preferred** — Offer 2-4 options when possible
3. **Build on answers** — Each question should refine understanding
4. **Explore alternatives** — Don't assume the first approach is best

## Question Types

| Type | When to Use | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Clarification | Vague requirement | "Should this be real-time or batch?" |
| Trade-off | Multiple valid approaches | "Prefer speed or memory efficiency?" |
| Boundary | Scope unclear | "Should this handle X case?" |
| Priority | Too many features | "Which matters more: A or B?" |

## Red Flags to Avoid

- Jumping to implementation
- Assuming requirements
- Skipping the "why"
- Not exploring alternatives

## Exit Criteria

Stop brainstorming when:
- Requirements are specific and bounded
- Acceptance criteria are clear
- Technical approach is decided
- User says "that's all"

Then transition to writing-plans or development-lifecycle.
